## Overview

![Airplane](./images/airplane.jpeg)

In this project, we delve deep into the dynamics of airline pricing and its various influencing factors. As a travel agency, our mission is to provide our clients with the best deals and help them understand the ever-changing landscape of airline prices.

We focus our analysis on a favorite airline. The data include multiple features:

- **miles**: miles traveled through the flight
- **passengers**: number of passengers on the flight
- **delay**: take-off delay in minutes
- **inflight_meal**: is there a meal included in the flight?
- **inflight_entertainment**: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
- **inflight_wifi**: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
- **day_of_week**: day of the week of the flight
- **weekend**: did this flight take place on a weekend
- **coach_price**: the average price paid for a coach ticket
- **firstclass_price**: the average price paid for first-class seats
- **hours**: how many hours the flight took
- **redeye**: was this flight a redeye (overnight)?

Our goal is to explore this dataset and get a thorough understanding of these features.
